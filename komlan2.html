            <p style="background-color: #44d4b4;">John von Neumann was a brilliant Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and engineer whose work had a major impact on the development of modern computing. In the 1940s, he joined a team working on one of the first electronic computers, the ENIAC, and later helped design its successor, the EDVAC. His most important contribution was the concept of the von Neumann architecture, a design where a computer's memory holds both instructions (the program) and data, allowing the machine to be programmed and reprogrammed more easily. This idea became the foundation for nearly all digital computers that followed. Von Neumann also contributed to fields such as game theory, quantum mechanics, and the development of nuclear weapons, but his influence on computer science remains one of his most lasting legacies. His vision helped transform computers from simple calculators into powerful, general-purpose machines.</p>
